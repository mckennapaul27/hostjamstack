      "oneOff": {
        "question": "1) Is it really a one-off payment?",
        "answer": "Yes. Each pack is a single payment. Packs with hosting keep your site live for the stated period. Near the end you can renew with another one-off, switch to monthly cover, or move elsewhere."
      },
      "hosting": {
        "question": "2) What does \"hosting included\" and \"fair-use\" mean?",
        "answer": "Hosting covers typical small-site usage. As guidance: ~50 GB/month bandwidth, ~250k function calls per month, and reasonable build activity. If you consistently exceed this, we'll flag it early and propose options before any extra costs apply."
      },
      "requirements": {
        "question": "3) What do you need from me to start?",
        "answer": "Read access to your Git repo, domain registrar/DNS access (or permission for us to manage it), and any required secrets (API keys, SMTP). For migrations: current host details and priority URLs. We support Next.js, Astro, Vite and plain static sites."
      },
      "speed": {
        "question": "4) How fast can you get me live?",
        "answer": "Most projects go live within a few business days once we have access and your domain is ready. DNS changes can take a short time to propagate. We'll confirm timelines up front."
      },
      "services": {
        "question": "5) Do you handle domains, email and databases?",
        "answer": "Domains/DNS/SSL — yes. Email — we don't host it; we'll configure DNS for Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. Databases — we don't host them; we'll integrate your site with a hosted DB/CMS you choose and set the environment variables."
      },
      "migration": {
        "question": "6) Can I move away later?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. No lock-in. You own the code, content and domain. We provide plain-speaking handover docs and can assist with transfer if you need it."
